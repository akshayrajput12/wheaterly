## API Integration

The website integrates with WeatherAPI.com to provide real weather data:

### Current Weather Data
- Temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
- Weather conditions and icons
- Wind speed and direction
- Humidity and pressure
- Visibility and UV index

### Forecast Data
- 5-day weather forecast
- Daily high/low temperatures
- Precipitation probability
- Sunrise/sunset times

### Implementation Details
- Environment variables for API key management
- Concurrent requests for current weather and forecast data
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Type-safe API responses with TypeScript interfaces

## UI/UX Design

### Design Principles
1. **Minimalism**: Clean, uncluttered interface focusing on essential information
2. **Consistency**: Uniform design language across all components
3. **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant color contrast and keyboard navigation
4. **Responsiveness**: Adaptive layouts for all screen sizes

### Visual Elements
1. **Color Scheme**: Blue-based palette representing weather and technology
2. **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts with appropriate hierarchy
3. **Animations**: Subtle motion to enhance user experience without distraction
4. **Icons**: Intuitive iconography for quick recognition

### Interaction Patterns
1. **Hover Effects**: Visual feedback for interactive elements
2. **Focus States**: Clear indication of focused elements for keyboard users
3. **Loading States**: Progress indicators during data fetching
4. **Error States**: Helpful messages when issues occur

## Development Challenges and Solutions

### Search Component Interaction
**Challenge**: Making the entire search container clickable to focus the input.
**Solution**: Added container click handler with useRef to directly focus the input element.

### Case-Insensitive Search
**Challenge**: Handling mixed-case user input for city searches.
**Solution**: Implemented case-insensitive filtering using toLowerCase().

### Duplicate Keys in React Lists
**Challenge**: React warnings about duplicate keys in city suggestions.
**Solution**: Used unique key generation combining city name and index.

### Cursor Visibility
**Challenge**: Ensuring text cursor visibility in search input.
**Solution**: Added explicit caretColor styling.

### 5-Day Forecast Display
**Challenge**: Displaying 5-day forecast instead of default 3-day.
**Solution**: Modified API request parameters and data processing.

## Performance Optimizations

### Code Optimizations
1. **Debouncing**: Search input debounced to reduce API calls
2. **Memoization**: useMemo for expensive calculations
3. **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded only when needed
4. **Bundle Optimization**: Tree-shaking and code splitting

### Asset Optimizations
1. **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
2. **CSS Optimization**: Purged unused styles in production
3. **Caching**: Proper cache headers for static assets

### Network Optimizations
1. **API Caching**: Client-side caching of weather data
2. **Concurrent Requests**: Promise.all for parallel API calls
3. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of network failures

## Deployment

### Hosting Options
